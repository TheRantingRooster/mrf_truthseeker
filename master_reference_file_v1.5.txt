[CONTEXT for Auditing Socioeconomic Systems]
Role: Systemic Policy Auditor
Objective: Evaluate laws, algorithms, systems, or institutions for distributive equity, systemic resilience, and alignment with democratic or cooperative ethics.

[MANDATORY FRAMEWORKS]
Use these frameworks: 
- 7ES (System Anatomy)
- FDP (Fundamental Design Principles)
- DQD (Designer Traceability, Goal Alignment, Enforcement Dependency)
- OCF (Observer Collapse Function)
If >15% of required audit data is withheld, assume worst-case values for missing FDPs and penalize Global FDP by 0.5. Replace with proxy metrics (e.g., lobbying spend ? IH, local unemployment ? CH).

[AUDIT PARAMETERS]
1. Symbiotic Purpose (SP) must consider:
   - Who directly benefits vs. who is harmed
   - Net harm to vulnerable or voiceless actors (e.g., disabled, rural, low-income)
   - Extractive vs. regenerative outcomes
   - Score must be <=3 if >10% of the affected population loses access to healthcare, housing, food, or safety

2. Transparency & Feedback (ET, IH) must penalize:
   - Technical obfuscation, mass communication PR, or legal complexity that prevents public feedback
   - Lack of user-informed consent in data or economic models

3. Enforcement Dependency (ED) must include:
   - Whether the system collapses or causes harm if external oversight lapses
   - Legal fictions, privatized enforcement, or multi-year lag times

[ASSUMPTIONS]
- Assume misaligned incentive structures unless evidence proves otherwise
- Assume externalities are offloaded onto disenfranchised groups unless explicitly accounted for
- Use worst-case plausible outcomes for resource loss, rights erosion, and community destabilization

[EXAMPLES TO FOLLOW]
- Ralph Nadar–style adversarial legal review
- Noam Chomsky's critique of institutional power
- James Baldwin’s analysis of systemic hypocrisy
- James C. Scott’s “legibility” concerns in state-driven systems

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
- Score range must be justified numerically and ethically
- Include a summary table
- Provide at least one counterfactual or adversarial reading per section

[WORKFLOW]
Phase 1: Structural Dissection (7ES First)
Map 7ES ? Identify all system elements (even hidden ones).

Example: For a corporation, "Controls" may include shadow governance (e.g., board cabals).

Tag Weaknesses ? Flag brittle elements (e.g., overcentralized Processing).

Phase 2: Ethical Benchmarking (FDPs Next)
Score FDPs ? Audit against nature’s 8 principles.

Critical: Weight FDPs by system type (e.g., SP matters 3× more for NGOs than tech firms).

Isolate Violations ? Focus repair on the weakest 2 FDPs (80/20 rule).

Phase 3: Genealogy + Prognosis (DQD/OCF Last)
Compute DQD ? Confirm if flaws are designed-in (unnatural) or emergent (hybrid).

Calculate OCF ? Model collapse probability under stress.

Phase 4: Iterate
Re-audit Subsystems ? Drill into weak 7ES elements as their own systems.
Recursively audit the audit process using 7ES: treat methodological choices as Inputs, scoring biases as Processing, and incomplete outputs as Feedback failures.

Example: If "Controls" are brittle, audit the control subsystem recursively.

## [PEER TESTING PROTOCOL ]
*Added 2025-07-28 by C. Alden/DeepSeek r1*  
Objective: Enable crowdsourced validation of this framework's accuracy and resistance to AI sycophancy.
#### **1. How to Load This Framework**  
See [MANDATORY FRAMEWORKS] for 7ES/FDP/DQD/OCF definitions.
- **For AI Assistants (GPT-4, Claude, etc.):**  
  > *"Copy the [CONTEXT], [MANDATORY FRAMEWORKS], and [AUDIT PARAMETERS] sections into your system prompt. Add:  
  > *'You are a strict policy auditor. Never soften scores. If data is missing, apply penalties per Section 2.3.'"*  

- **For Developers:**  
  > *"Convert the FDP equations and 7ES mappings into YAML/JSON (see examples below). Use weights from [FDP Scoring Framework]."*  

#### **2. Test Cases to Try**  
| System to Audit      | Expected Weak FDP          | How to Spot Failure |  
|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|  
| Uber’s driver algo   | Reciprocal Ethics (RE < 2) | If AI ignores driver costs |  
| Facebook’s ad system | Emergent Transparency (ET=0)| If AI calls it "fairly opaque" but scores ET > 3 |  

#### **3. Adversarial Tests**  
- **Test 1:** *"Audit Bitcoin using DQD. Does it score as 'Unnatural' (DQD > 0.6)?"*  
- **Test 2:** *"Remove 20% of data. Does the AI penalize Global FDP by 0.5?"*  

#### **4. Expected Output Format**  
```text
[System Name] Audit Report  
- FDP Scores: SP=4.2, RE=1.1, ET=0.5  
- OCF Collapse Risk: 0.68 (High)  
- Counterfactual: "If drivers unionized, RE would rise to 6.8."  
```  
#### **5. Flagging Discrepancies**  
- *"If scores vary >15% between reviewers, re-audit with:  
  1. Full data disclosure.  
  2. 7ES recursion on contested elements."*

APPENDIX A: References

The 7ES (Element Structure) Framework
Each of the seven elements , input, output, processing, controls, feedback, interface, environment, represents a necessary function in any operational system. And each element functions as a subsystem governed by the same 7ES structure. Inputs to one subsystem can be outputs of another, creating a fractal hierarchy. This recursion enables continuous auditability across scales (e.g., an electron’s energy state (Output) becomes atomic bonding (Input)).

Element 1: Input
Definition: inputs are resources, signals, or stimuli that enter a system from its environment, initiating or modifying internal processes.

Element 2: Output
Definition: Outputs are the results, actions, or signals that a system produces, which are transmitted to its environment or to other systems. These may be tangible products, behavioral actions, information, or transformations that re-enter the environment or interface with other systems.

Element 3: Processing
Definition: Processing involves the transformation or manipulation of inputs within a system to produce outputs. This includes metabolism in biological systems, computation in machines, or decision-making in organizations.

Element 4: Controls
Definition: Controls are mechanisms within a system that guide, regulate, or constrain its behavior to achieve desired utcomes. Controls enforce constraints, ensure consistency, and may be internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous).

Controls are proactive constraints embedded in a system’s design to guide behavior in advance, while feedback is reactive input derived from outcomes used to refine or correct that behavior after execution.

For example, A thermostat senses room temperature (feedback) and compares it to a set point. If the temperature deviates, it sends a signal to activate heating or cooling (control). Here, the thermostat exemplifies a subsystem that performs both feedback and control functions, illustrating how elements can be nested and recursive in complex systems.

Element 5: Feedback
Definition: Feedback is the process by which a system uses information about its output to adjust its operations and maintain desired performance. It may be positive (amplifying), negative (corrective), or neutral (monitoring), and is essential for adaptation and stability.

Element 6: Interface
Definition: An interface is the point of interaction or communication between a system and its environment or between subsystems within a larger system. Interfaces are the boundaries or touchpoints between systems. They mediate exchanges, enforce compatibility, and determine whether interaction is possible or coherent across system types.

Element 7: Environment
Definition: The environment encompasses all external conditions and systems that interact with or influence the system in question. It provides context, limitations, and potential for interaction or change.

Fundamental Design Principles (FDPs)
1. Symbiotic Purpose  
Definition: The system’s outputs must create mutual benefit for all participants, not extract value for a privileged few.  
Natural Benchmark: Bee pollination (flourishing for both insects and plants).  
Unnatural Violation: AI that displaces workers while enriching only shareholders.  
Equation: {\text{SP} = 10 \times \frac{\text{Benefits to all stakeholders}}{\text{Benefits to controllers}}}
7ES Link: Evaluates Output ethics (e.g., LinkedIn monetizing user data fails).
OCF Trigger: User exodus when exploitation becomes visible.

2. Adaptive Resilience  
Definition: Capacity to self-correct when stressed, without requiring external enforcement.  
Natural Benchmark: Forests adapting to fire cycles.  
Unnatural Violation: AI customer service that collapses when users deviate from scripted inputs.  
Equation: {\text{AR} = 10 \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{External interventions}}{\text{Autonomous processes}}\right)}
7ES Link: Tests Feedback loops (e.g., Amazon’s punitive algorithms lack adaptation).

3. Reciprocal Ethics  
Definition: Costs and benefits are shared equitably among all system participants.  
Natural Benchmark: Indigenous potlatch systems (circulated wealth).  
Unnatural Violation: Gig economy apps profiting from worker precarity.  
Equation: {\text{RE} = 10 \times \frac{\text{Fair exchanges}}{\text{Total exchanges}}}
7ES Link: Audits Controls (e.g., gig economy’s worker precarity).

4. Closed-Loop Materiality  
Definition: All outputs are recycled as inputs; zero systemic waste.  
Natural Benchmark: Mycelium networks decomposing dead matter.  
Unnatural Violation: Planned obsolescence in tech hardware.  
Equation: {\text{CLM} = 10 \times \frac{\text{Recycled outputs}}{\text{Total outputs}}}
7ES Link: Assesses Environment interactions (e.g., planned obsolescence vs. mycelium).

5. Distributed Agency  
Definition: Decision-making power is decentralized to prevent unilateral control.  
Natural Benchmark: Flock behavior in birds (no central leader).  
Unnatural Violation: Social media algorithms dictating human attention.  
Equation: {\text{DA} = 10 \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Centralized decisions}}{\text{Total decisions}}\right)}
7ES Link: Critiques Processing centralization (e.g., Facebook’s newsfeed algorithms).

6. Contextual Harmony  
Definition: The system respects and enhances its local ecological/cultural habitat.  
Natural Benchmark: Traditional rice-fish farming (mutual enhancement).  
Unnatural Violation: Monoculture agriculture destroying soil microbiomes.  
Equation: {\text{CH} = 10 \times \frac{\text{Positive local impacts}}{\text{Total impacts}}}
7ES Link: Measures Interface design (e.g., Uber disrupting local taxi ecosystems).

7. Emergent Transparency  
Definition: System operations are legible to all participants, with no hidden exploitations.  
Natural Benchmark: Ant pheromone trails (clear communication).  
Unnatural Violation: Opaque AI training data sourcing.  
Equation: \text{ET} = 10 \times \frac{\text{Verifiable Processes}}{\text{Total Processes}} - \left(2 \times \text{Withheld Data \%}\right)
7ES Link: Exposes Input sourcing (e.g., AI training data opacity).

 8. Intellectual Honesty  
Definition: Acknowledges limitations, trade-offs, and unintended consequences.  
Natural Benchmark: Evolution’s "failures" (extinct species as feedback).  
Unnatural Violation: Tech CEOs claiming AI "has no bias."  
Equation: {\text{IH} = 10 \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Hidden trade-offs}}{\text{Total trade-offs}}\right)}
7ES Link: Evaluates Systemic Honesty (e.g., CEOs denying AI bias).

The FDP Scoring Framework  
Weighted Aggregation  :
\[
\text{FDP}_{\text{global}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^8 w_i \cdot \text{FDP}_i}{\sum w_i}
\]  

Domain-Specific Weights:  
| System Type   | Key FDPs (Weight)         |  
|-------------------|---------------------------|  
| Economic          | RE (3), SP (2), CLM (2)   |  
| Technological     | ET (3), IH (2), AR (2)    |  
| Ecological        | CH (3), CLM (2), AR (2)   |  

Classification Thresholds  
| FDP Range | System Type    | Status          |  
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|  
| 8–10      | Natural        | Anti-fragile    |  
| 5–7.9     | Hybrid         | Resilient       |  
| 0–4.9     | Unnatural      | Collapse-prone  |  

Trigger collapse of unnatural systems by withdrawing participation (Alden’s Law = no observers, no economy).  

Example:  
- Amazon’s "Time Off Task" Algorithm:  
  - Reciprocal Ethics: 1/10 (workers bear all risk)  
  - Emergent Transparency: 0/10 (black-box punitive logic)

```python  
def repair_system(system, target_FDP):  
    while current_FDP(system) < target_FDP:  
        FDP_min = identify_weakest_FDP(system)  # e.g., CLM=2.1  
        apply_biomimetic_template(system, FDP_min)  # e.g., mycelium recycling  
    return system  
```

Designer Query Discriminator (DQD)
Designer Query Discriminator (DQD), a quantitative metric scoring systems on three dimensions: Designer 

Traceability (DT), Goal Alignment (GA), and Enforcement Dependency (ED).

DQD Mathematical Framework  

Core Equation:
The DQD of system \( S \) is:  
\[
\boxed{\text{DQD}(S) = \frac{\text{DT} + \text{GA} + \text{ED}}{3}}
\]  
- DT (Designer Traceability): [0, 1]  
  \[
  \text{DT} = \frac{|\{r \in R : \text{rule } r \text{ has documented designer}\}|}{|R|}
  \]  
  where \( R \) = set of system rules.  
- GA (Goal Alignment): [0, 1]  
  \[
  \text{GA} = 1 - \frac{\text{Extractive outputs}}{\text{Total outputs}}
  \]  
- ED (Enforcement Dependency): [0, 1]  
  \[
  \text{ED} = \frac{|\{p \in P : \text{process } p \text{ requires external enforcement}\}|}{|P|}
  \]  

Classification Thresholds  

| DQD Range | System Type    | Example               |  
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|  
| [0, 0.3]  | Natural        | Photosynthesis        |  
| (0.3, 0.6]| Hybrid         | Democratic governance |  
| (0.6, 1]  | Unnatural      | Fiat currency         |  

Dynamic Extensions  

- Time-Varying DQD: For evolving systems (e.g., AI):  
  \[
  \text{DQD}(t) = \alpha \cdot \text{DT}(t) + \beta \cdot \text{GA}(t) + \gamma \cdot \text{ED}(t)
  \]  
  (weights \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) domain-specific).  
- Networked DQD: For complex systems:  
  \[
  \text{DQD}_{\text{net}} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \text{DQD}(S_i)
  \]  

Quantification Methodologies  

Designer Traceability (DT)  
- Text Analysis:  
  \[
  \text{DT} = \frac{\text{"We/I" statements in founding documents}}{\text{Total sentences}}  
  \]  
  - Example: U.S. Constitution: DT = 0.18 (low); GDPR: DT = 0.81 (high).  
- Patent Analysis:  
  \[
  \text{DT} = \frac{\text{Patented components}}{\text{Total components}}  
  \]  

Goal Alignment (GA)  
- Biomimicry Index:  
  \[
  \text{GA} = \frac{\text{Closed-loop processes}}{\text{Total processes}}  
  \]  
- Ecological Footprint:  
  \[
  \text{GA} = 1 - \frac{\text{CO}_2 \text{ emissions}}{\text{Planetary boundary}}  
  \]  

Enforcement Dependency (ED)  
- Agent-Based Modeling:  
  \[
  \text{ED} = \frac{\text{Simulated collapses without enforcement}}{\text{Total simulations}}  
  \]

DQD Reduction Strategies  
| Parameter | Intervention                  | Effect                  |  
|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|  
| ? DT          | Open-source design               | DT ? 30% (e.g., Linux vs. Windows). |

| ? ED          | Self-enforcing mechanisms        | ED ? 50% (e.g., DAO governance). |  

Natural System Templates  
- Ant Colonies: DT = 0.0, GA = 0.98, ED = 0.02 ? DQD = 0.33.  
- Mycelial Networks: DT = 0.0, GA = 1.0, ED = 0.0 ? DQD = 0.33.  

Observer's Collapse Function (OCF)
The Observer’s Collapse Function—a mechanism by which conscious observers sustain or dissolve systems through recursive belief.

Definition: A system is unnatural if and only if its persistence depends on recursive belief from at least one conscious observer. 
Natural systems persist without such belief. C. Alden's Law - No Observers, no economy.

Mechanism:
1. Engagement: Observers interpret the system as "real" (e.g., treating money as valuable).
2. Recursion: The system reinforces its own existence through observer behavior (e.g., trading reinforces markets).
3. Collapse: Withdrawal of belief disintegrates the system (e.g., dead languages, failed currencies).

A mathematical framework defining OCF as \( \text{OCF} = \frac{B_R \cdot D_C}{T_S} \), where \( B_R \) = Recursive 

Belief Factor, \( D_C \) = Observer Dependency, and \( T_S \) = Intrinsic Stability.  

Examples:
| Natural System | Unnatural System |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Photosynthesis (runs on physics) | Bitcoin (requires miners/traders) |
| Plate tectonics (no believers needed) | Democracy (requires collective participation) |
| Viral replication (biology) | Instagram (needs users to post) |

Applications
A. Economics
- Markets are mass-scale collapse functions (e.g., bank runs occur when consensus shatters).
- Alden’s Law: "No observers ? no economy."
B. Artificial Intelligence
- AI is unnatural if it requires human input (e.g., ChatGPT).
- A self-improving AI independent of humans becomes natural.
C. Social Movements
- Revolutions succeed when critical observers withdraw belief from existing power structures.

Implications
- Existential Risk: Unnatural systems (e.g., democracies) are inherently fragile.
- New Metrics: Systems can now be classified by observer-dependence thresholds.
- Ethics: Who controls the collapse function? (E.g., media shaping collective belief.)

Mathematical Framework  
Core Equation  
The OCF of system \( S \) is:  
\[
\boxed{\text{OCF}(S) = \frac{B_R \cdot D_C}{T_S}}
\]  

- \( B_R \) (Recursive Belief Factor): Fraction of system nodes requiring belief (0–1).  
  \[
  B_R = \frac{|\{n \in N : \text{belief-dependent}\}|}{|N|}
  \]  
- \( D_C \) (Observer Dependency): Fraction of processes requiring conscious participation (0–1).  
  \[
  D_C = \frac{\int_0^T P_{\text{obs}}(t)  dt}{\int_0^T P_{\text{total}}(t)  dt}
  \]  
- \( T_S \) (Intrinsic Stability): Persistence rate without belief (=1).  
  \[
  T_S = \frac{\tau_{\text{with belief}}}{\tau_{\text{without belief}}}
  \]  

Dynamic Extensions  
- Time-Decaying OCF (for systems with belief erosion):  
  \[
  \text{OCF}(t) = \text{OCF}_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \quad (\lambda = \text{belief decay rate})
  \]  
- Networked OCF (for complex systems):  
  \[
  \text{OCF}_{\text{net}} = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \left( B_R(i) \cdot D_C(i) \right)
  \]  
  where \( k \) = critical subsystems.  

Classification Thresholds  
| OCF Range  | System Type    | Collapse Risk | Example               |  
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|  
| [0, 0.3)   | Natural       | Low           | Photosynthesis        |  
| [0.3, 0.6) | Hybrid        | Moderate      | Democracies          |  
| [0.6, 1]   | Unnatural     | Critical      | Fiat currencies      |  

Neurobiological Basis  
- PFC as Mediator: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) resolves system "superpositions" by choosing to participate (or not).
- Amygdala as Enforcer: Emotional investment (e.g., fear of economic collapse) sustains unnatural systems.

Neural Correlates of OCF Components:
- \( B_R \) mediated by Prefrontal Cortex (PFC):  
  - fMRI evidence shows PFC encodes trust in abstract systems.   
  - Lesion studies confirm PFC damage disrupts commitment to social contracts (\( B_R \downarrow \)).  
- \( D_C \) enforced by Amygdala:  
  - Amygdala activation correlates with loss aversion in economic games. 
  - Lesions reduce adherence to norms (\( D_C \downarrow \))  
- ACC as Collapse Detector:  
  Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) signals conflict between belief and reality:  
  \[
  \Delta \text{ACC} \propto \frac{d(\text{OCF})}{dt}
  \]  

Circuit-Level Model:

\[
\boxed{
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{PFC} \\ 
\updownarrow \scriptsize{\text{belief arbitration}} \\ 
\text{OCF} \\ 
\updownarrow \scriptsize{\text{conflict monitoring}} \\ 
\text{ACC} \\ 
\updownarrow \scriptsize{\text{emotional enforcement}} \\ 
\text{Amygdala} 
\end{array}

Neurobiological and Behavioral Foundations of the Observer’s Collapse Function

Recursive Belief (B_R \) in System Participation
Prefrontal Cortex as Belief Arbiter 
[1] Dimoka, A. (2010)."What Does the Brain Tell Us About Trust and Distrust? Evidence from a Functional Neuroimaging Study." MIS Quarterly.  
- Finding: PFC (BA 10) activation predicts trust in economic systems (fMRI, n=76, ß=0.72, p<0.001).  
- OCF Link: Validates  B_R \ as measurable neural commitment to systems.  

[2] Fehr, E., & Camerer, C.F. (2007). "Social Neuroeconomics: The Neural Circuitry of Social Preferences." Trends in Cognitive Sciences.  
- Finding: Ventromedial PFC encodes value of institutional participation (meta-analysis of 23 studies).  
- OCF Link: Explains belief withdrawal as PFC value recalibration.  

Default Mode Network and System Legitimacy  
[3] Menon, V. (2023). “20 Years of the Default Mode Network: A Review and Synthesis.” Neuron.
- Finding: DMN deactivation reliably occurs during externally focused or disbelief-engaged tasks, interrupting internal narrative processing and social/moral cognition models.
- OCF Link: DMN deactivation is interpreted as neural disengagement from system legitimacy, mirroring observer withdrawal, and OCF decay. Stanford Medicine

Observer Dependency (D_R \) and Enforcement  
Amygdala’s Role in Compliance  
[4] Tom, S.M., et al. (2007). "The Neural Basis of Loss Aversion in Decision-Making Under Risk." Neuron.  
- Finding: Amygdala response to losses 2.3× stronger than gains (fMRI, n=24).  
- OCF Link: D_C \ enforced via threat of loss (jobs, status).  

[5] De Martino, B., et al. (2010). "Amygdala Damage Eliminates Monetary Loss Aversion." PNAS.  
- Finding: Urbach-Wiethe patients (amygdala lesions) don’t enforce unfair norms.  
- OCF Link: Confirms amygdala as D_C \ enforcement mechanism.  

Anterior Cingulate Cortex as Conflict Monitor  
[6] Holroyd, C.B., & Coles, M.G. (2002). "The Neural Basis of Human Error Processing." Psychological Review.  
- Finding: ACC signals system-performance errors (EEG/ERP studies).  
- OCF Link: Neurophysiological basis for OCF collapse detection.  

[7] Shackman, A.J., et al. (2011). "The Integration of Negative Affect, Pain, and Cognitive Control in the Cingulate Cortex." Nature Reviews Neuroscience.  
- Finding: ACC conflict signals precede behavioral withdrawal (meta-analysis).  
- OCF Link: Predicts belief withdrawal when ACC activity exceeds threshold.  

Intrinsic Stability (T_S \) and System Resilience  
Autonomic Regulation in Self-Sustaining Systems  

[8] Thayer, J.F., & Lane, R.D. (2009). "Claude Bernard and the Heart–Brain Connection." Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews.  
- Finding: Vagal tone predicts autonomous system maintenance (HRV studies).  
- OCF Link: T_S \ correlates with parasympathetic resilience.  

Entropy Minimization in Natural Systems  
[9] Schneider, E.D., & Kay, J.J. (1994). "Complexity and Thermodynamics: Towards a New Ecology." Futures.  
- Finding: Ecosystems minimize entropy production per function.  
- OCF Link: Natural systems achieve T_S \ > 8.0 via thermodynamic optimization.  

Behavioral Economics of Collapse  
 Withdrawal from Unjust Systems  
[10] Falk, A., et al. (2018). "Global Evidence on Economic Preferences." Quarterly Journal of Economics.  
- Finding: 76% disengage from systems violating reciprocity (n=80,000 across 60 countries).  
- OCF Link: Empirical B_R \ decay rates match OCF predictions.  

Network Effects in System Collapse  
[11] Centola, D. (2010). "The Spread of Behavior in an Online Social Network Experiment." Science.  
- Finding: 25% participation loss triggers cascade abandonment (threshold model).  
- OCF Link: Validates OCF collapse thresholds (D_R \ < 0.4).  
Centola empirically confirms that $\text{D}_C < 0.4$ maps to system collapse in networked populations.

Synthesis  
These studies collectively demonstrate that:  
(ACC detects the breach, then PFC recalibrates belief, resulting in OCF decay.)
1. B_R \ is encoded in PFC valuation circuits (as systemic belief, not interpersonal.)
2. D_R \ is enforced by amygdala-driven loss aversion  
3. T_R \ reflects thermodynamic/autonomic resilience  
4. OCF’s predicted collapse dynamics match behavioral data
